# borg-stuff-vrchat
VRChat conversion of "Borg Stuff" university project

## Acknowledgements

These assets were made in April 2011 when I was a student.  It's clear that a few elements of it were not made by myself but I don't recall their exact origins, which is why this project is not licensed.  I shall attempt to list them here:

### Borg Font

Most of the UI displays were drawn using Adobe Flash, but they include detailed Borg symbology I do not believe I drew myself.  I probably used a font for this such as [this one](https://www.st-minutiae.com/resources/fonts/index.html).

### Sound Effects

Most of the sound effects were synthesized inside Audacity, I found an attribution note for the [spark sound effect](http://www.freesound.org/samplesViewSingle.php?id=94128).
